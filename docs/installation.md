## From sources

The sources for ghreport can be downloaded from the
[Github repo](https://github.com/osl-incubator/ghreport.git).

You can either clone the public repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/osl-incubator/ghreport.git
```

Or download the
[tarball](https://github.com/osl-incubator/ghreport.git/tarball/main):

Once you have a copy of the source, change to the project root directory and
install it with:

```

PS: You need to have poetry installed. You can use it also from a conda
environment. Check the `Contributing` page for more information.
